# arduino_blaulicht

This very simple sketch was tested with old Arduino 1.x IDEs 
and the latest [2.0.0-beta11](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
on Arduino Uno, Nano and an Adafruit Trinket microcontroller.

## Material

- Arduino (Uno)
- 2 blue LEDs
- Use two 220 Ohm dropping resistors to protect the Arduino Pins and LEDs

## Wiring

- Wire the LEDs and resistors with pins 11 and 12
- Upload this sketch to Arduino

## Other Resources

### Trinket

To miniaturize and mobilize the setup, you may use an Adafruit trinket
with a LiPoly battery backpack:
